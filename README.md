# Super_Duo_Project
Super Duo is comprised of two apps, Alexandria-- a booklist and barcode scanner app, and Football Scores-- which provides users the latest European Football matches (schedule and scores). Sascha Jaschke provided the code for the Udacity Nanodegree Program. I implemented a barcode scanner for Alexandria and a collections widget for Football Scores. I also allowed for localization; added content descriptions, accessibility, and layout mirroring; and implemented error handling. The Football Scores app's api key has been redacted. You can obtain an api key from www.football-data.org.
